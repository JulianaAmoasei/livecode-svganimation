# SVG Animation Live Code

In my Smashing Toronto talk, I'll be live coding an SVG animation from start to finish. Here's the repo that houses the base materials, and any further references for things we don't have time to cover.

## Tools that I use or mention during the course of the talk

- Codepen-safe versions of the [GSAP Plugins](http://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/OPqpRJ)
- Codepen debugger [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codopen/agnkphdgffianchpipdbkeaclfbobaak)
- Google image search, reuse with modification [example](https://www.google.com/search?q=thing&tbm=isch&source=lnt&tbs=sur:fmc&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjo3bL8utbbAhUM44MKHcH2BgwQpwUIIA&biw=1289&bih=1209&dpr=1)
- Adobe Illustrator ([this is paid](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html), but [inkscape is free](https://inkscape.org/en/))
- SVGOMG, an [optimizer for SVG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)
